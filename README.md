# CineScope.API
RESTful API for CRUD operations on a SQL Server database that stores film-related data, with Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation. My goal with this project was to build a scalable and user-friendly movie catalog API that can be integrated into other applications or services, such as a movie recommendation engine or a film review platform.
